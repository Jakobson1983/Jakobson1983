Hi, my name is Jakub.
I have started a new project titled "My First Work." 
At the beginning, I was learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and currently i learn Cypress. 
I also prepare me for ISTQB exam.
I work with Linux terminal.
Ultimately, I am aiming to pursue a career as an automated tester.  
I am looking for collaboration on projects suitable for beginners, 
and I kindly ask for a critical review of my work along with some advice on how I can improve. 
You can reach me via phone at +49 17646109403 and email me at zytlinski.jakub@gmail.com.
